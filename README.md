# Taxi_Tip_CalCulation_Using_Regression_Model
We will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using a popular regression model: Decision Tree.
## Taxi Tip Calculation Model using Snap ML of IBM
* Perform basic data preprocessing using Scikit-Learn
* Model a regression task using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML Python APIs
* Train a Decision Tree Regressor model using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML
* Utilize dataset information provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)
* Predict the amount of tip paid using the trained model
* Run inference and assess the quality of the trained models
